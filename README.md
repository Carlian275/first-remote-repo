This is my first GIT project.
Tyranitar is quadruple weak to fighting.

A new feature is a Tera-Ghost Tyranitar.

Tera-Flying Tyranitar might also be helpful depending on the teammates. 

Tyranitar-Excadrill combo will outspeed most teams.

Another good combo will be a swift-swim rain team with Basculegion and Pelipper.
